# KAZAKH-WORDS-ENDINGS-PUB
The creation and use of a complete system of Kazakh endings has the following grounds:
1) The Kazakh language belongs to low-resource languages, so the creation of language resources for it is important.
2) Although neural machine translation has shown impressive results for many world languages, 
it does not solve the problem of low-resource languages. Therefore, the development of tools perfecting the use of NMT
for low-resource languages is relevant.
3) There are other areas of natural language processing, such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, summarization, etc., 
which require knowledge of the subject area, in this case, deep semantic knowledge of the Kazakh language. Therefore, 
the creation of a language resource that allows improving the processing of the Kazakh language is necessary.
4) Development of a complete system of endings of the Kazakh language will allow in one step (referring to the table of the system 
of endings of the language) to perform: segmentation of the word into suffixes; perform morphological analysis of the word. 
Since the ending system will have a decision for the each ending of the language to segment into suffixes or suffixes 
with their morphological characteristics (for morphological analysis).
5) The development of a complete system of endings of the Kazakh language allows to guarantee the analysis of almost any word 
of the Kazakh language, as this is determined by the inferring of the complete system of endings of the language.
